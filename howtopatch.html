<b>Basic Patch System with asar on windows using a .bat file</b>
<br>
<b>for easy push/pull pc patches usage</b>
</p>

<b>1) Download Asar and unzip it you can find it here : <a href="https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar/releases/tag/v1.81">Asar</a></b><br>
<br>
<br>
<b>2) (optional, read note *) put Asar.exe in your PATH Environment Variables on windows for easier use</b><br>
*if you do not follow that step you will have copy Asar.exe in each of your projects folders
or reference the path in the build.bat file
<br>
put Asar.exe in a folder easy to access for example "C:\Asar\Asar.exe"
press Win+S or click on the search button on the taskbar and search for "variable" without quotes
click on "Edit the system environment variables" it will open a System Properties window
at the bottom right there is a Environment Variables... button click on it
in the top section there is a Variable called "Path", select it and click "Modify"
Add a new one called "C:\Asar" or the folder where you've put Asar
<br>
<br>
<b>3) Create a .bat file for patch automation you can write it yourself or copy the one below</b><br>
also IMPORTANT make sure your rom file extension is .sfc otherwise asar will think your rom have a header
you put that .bat file in your projects folders where your rom hack is, then edit the name of "alttp.sfc"

<br>
Content of build.bat :
<h3>
    copy alttp.sfc patched.sfc
    asar main.asm patched.sfc
    pause
</h3>
<br>

basically what this is doing is copy your rom "alttp.sfc" in a file named "patched.sfc"
then it will use Asar on your patched.sfc with the code contained in main.asm file
<br>
<br>
<b>4) Create a "main.asm" file, that file will contains all your asm patches like the example below</b><br>
anything after ; is a comment you can add more patches to it by adding the patch.asm in your project folder
and by calling the function "incsrc mypatch.asm"
<br>
<h3>
    Content of main.asm :
    org $2A8000 ; Set writing position to 0x150000 in the ROM (expanded region)
    
    incsrc "patch.asm" ; will patch the file named patch.asm in the rom
    ; you can add more patches here
</h3>
<br>
note that you can also create folders for better organisation for example
Projects\Patches\Sprites\Sickkiditem.asm
then instead of just incsrc the patch you put the path like
incsrc "Patches\Sprites\Sickkiditem.asm"
that way if you use many patches they won't all be in the same folder
<br>
<br>
<b>5) once you have all the patches you want in your project folder</b><br>
you can just double click on the "build.bat" file that is in your project folder
you should see a console window appearing with very few lines in it
with a press a key to continue... message, if you do not see any messages errors then it worked
you can proceed by opening the file "patched.sfc" that is in your project folder
that is the ROM containing all your ASM patched in, note that this rom should not be edited with an editor
it should only be meant to be used for testing and for release!
that way if there is a problem with an asm you do not corrupt your entire rom
<br>
also last important point that system is made for specific asm patches that are using pushpc and pullpc
if the patch you are using is not using pushpc/pullpc and contains an org in it, it will mess it up
you can ask in #asm-request of ZScream discord if you don't know how to convert a patch to use push/pull pc :)
<br>
That's it, have fun!
<br>
Some patches might require some editing for the values.
